# Hyperlocal Marketplace Backend

A robust, scalable, production-ready backend system for a hyperlocal marketplace platform. This backend serves both a website and an Android application, allowing customers to discover nearby local shops and their products based on geo-location.

## Project Overview

The Hyperlocal Marketplace Backend is built as a microservices architecture using FastAPI with full async support. It enables:

- Customers to discover nearby shops based on their location
- Sellers to register shops and manage product inventory
- Admin users to monitor and manage the platform
- Authentication via Firebase (OTP, Google, Apple)
- Geo-location based shop discovery
- Product catalog management

## Tech Stack

- **Language**: Python 3.11+
- **Framework**: FastAPI (with full async support)
- **Validation**: Pydantic
- **ORM**: SQLAlchemy (Async ORM)
- **Database**: MySQL
- **Architecture**: Microservices
- **Authentication**: Firebase Auth (OTP login, Google, Apple)
- **Media Storage**: AWS S3
- **Geo Queries**: Location filtering for shop discovery
- **Deployment**: Docker + Docker Compose

## Microservices

The backend is divided into the following microservices:

1. **User Service** (Port 8001)
   - User registration and authentication
   - Token-based session management
   - Role-based access control (Customer, Seller, Admin)

2. **Seller Service** (Port 8002)
   - Shop registration and management
   - Product inventory management
   - Image upload to S3

3. **Customer Service** (Port 8003)
   - Shop discovery based on location
   - Shop filtering and sorting by distance
   - Product browsing from nearby shops

4. **Product Catalog Service** (Port 8004)
   - Pre-filled catalog of 100+ electronics items
   - Search and filtering capabilities
   - Category management

5. **Admin Panel Backend** (Port 8005)
   - User, shop, and product management
   - System monitoring and logging
   - Activity tracking

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.11+
- MySQL 8.0+
- Docker and Docker Compose (for containerized deployment)
- Firebase project (for authentication)
- AWS account (for S3 storage)

### Local Development Setup

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/hyperlocal-marketplace.git
   cd hyperlocal-marketplace
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Create a `.env` file based on `.env.sample`:
   ```bash
   cp .env.sample .env
   # Edit .env with your configuration
   ```

5. Run database migrations:
   ```bash
   alembic upgrade head
   ```

6. Seed the database with initial data:
   ```bash
   python -m services.catalog_service.seed.seed_database
   ```

7. Start each service individually (in separate terminals):
   ```bash
   uvicorn services.user_service.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8001 --reload
   uvicorn services.seller_service.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8002 --reload
   uvicorn services.customer_service.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8003 --reload
   uvicorn services.catalog_service.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8004 --reload
   uvicorn services.admin_service.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8005 --reload
   ```

### Docker Deployment

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/hyperlocal-marketplace.git
   cd hyperlocal-marketplace
   ```

2. Create a `.env` file based on `.env.sample`:
   ```bash
   cp .env.sample .env
   # Edit .env with your configuration
   ```

3. Build and start the containers:
   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

4. Run database migrations:
   ```bash
   docker-compose exec user-service alembic upgrade head
   ```

5. Seed the database with initial data:
   ```bash
   docker-compose exec catalog-service python -m services.catalog_service.seed.seed_database
   ```

6. Access the services:
   - User Service: http://localhost:8001
   - Seller Service: http://localhost:8002
   - Customer Service: http://localhost:8003
   - Product Catalog Service: http://localhost:8004
   - Admin Panel Backend: http://localhost:8005

## API Documentation

Each service provides Swagger documentation at the `/docs` endpoint:

- User Service: http://localhost:8001/docs
- Seller Service: http://localhost:8002/docs
- Customer Service: http://localhost:8003/docs
- Product Catalog Service: http://localhost:8004/docs
- Admin Panel Backend: http://localhost:8005/docs

## Authentication

The system uses Firebase Authentication for user login, supporting:
- OTP-based phone authentication
- Google Sign-In
- Apple Sign-In

After authentication, the system issues JWT tokens for subsequent API calls.

## Database Schema

The database includes the following main tables:
- users: User accounts and authentication
- shops: Seller shop information and geo-location
- catalog_items: Product catalog with specifications
- categories: Product categories
- shop_inventory: Products available in shops
- customer_preferences: User preferences for discovery
- admin_logs: Admin activity tracking
